😄 Facial Expression Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a deep learning project that identifies human emotions from facial images. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect expressions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more — making machines more emotionally aware.

📌 Key Features
🎯 Accurate classification of 7 facial expressions

🧠 CNN-based deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras

📊 Training history and performance visualization

🖼️ Preprocessing pipeline for FER2013 dataset

🎥 (Optional) Real-time emotion detection with webcam using OpenCV

📁 Dataset
We use the FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle:

35,887 grayscale facial images (48x48 pixels)

Labeled with 7 emotions:

😠 Angry

🤢 Disgust

😨 Fear

😄 Happy

😢 Sad

😲 Surprise

😐 Neutral

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools (Optional): OpenCV for webcam-based real-time detection
